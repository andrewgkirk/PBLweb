Every year we recruit new students for Masters and PhD degrees who are keen to apply their photonics expertise to the exciting and multidisciplinary problem of biosensing. We seek students who enjoy hands-on experimentation and who also have good theoretical skills and the ability to undertake numerical modeling. Students must also be willing to engage with biologists, medical researchers and chemists. Most new students start in September each year, but we also sometimes take new students on in January. Departmental deadlines and application information are available [here](https://www.mcgill.ca/ece/graduate/graduate). If you are interested please send an [email]("mailto:andrew.kirk@mcgill.ca") to the laboratory director with your CV and a recent transcript.
