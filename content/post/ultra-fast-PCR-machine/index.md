We are collaborating with [Pronto Medical Technologies](https://prontomedtech.com) and [Nanopartz Inc](https://www.nanopartz.com/) to commercialise our plasmonic PCR technology to create an [ultrafast PCR machine](https://www.nanopartz.com/plasmonic-pcr.asp). This will target the detection of COVID-19 RNA.
