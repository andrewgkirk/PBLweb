The research laboratories of Mark Trifiro and Andrew Kirk recently obtained funding from CIHR to pursue urgent research to develop a rapid point-of-care detection system for COVID-19 infection. This system will be based on our ultrafast plasmonic PCR technique, and has the potential to yield a result in 15 minutes.
